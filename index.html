        <! --4.The "Head" of the document defines data about the document. So, we can define things like the "title" of the document, we can give the document a "description", we can define other attributes about the document like maybe an "image" that´s associated to the document. We can also use the "head" to import any resources that we need into our HTML file. You will find out later that we can  actually link this HTML file to other types of files and Inside of the "head" we can do all of that. The head is sort of like the settings oF the HTML file. It´s like the command center. It´s sort of like metadata about the actual file and we can create the "head" by creating "head" tags. -->

    <body>
        <! --5.The "Body" tag is where we´ll put like the meat and the bones of  the HTML page. The body tag is where  all of our HTML content is going to go. Generally, the body is gonna be a lot bigger than the head. The body is where you´re actually putting all the content for your web page. So anything that´s in the body for the most part is gonna show up or at least it´s gonna get rendered by the browser. --> 
        
        <p> It means Paragraph</p> <! --8. This Paragraph tag would be the grandchild of this HTML tag.>
       

    </body>


</html>

<! --6.The web browser can actually like parse through all these different tags and it can figure out how to display all of the information so you can define informations and you can use tags to help define that information and layut that information differently and the web browser will be able to parse through all of  that and basically decipher it and use it to build a website. -->

<! --7. About family terminology: In our structure we have the "html" as a parent of the "head" and the "body" tags. The "body" and the "head" tags are "Child Tags" of "html". it is beacuse they are inside the "html" tag. We will define too that these  body and head tags as "Sibling Tags". -->

<! --9. These terminology are define as "Generational Sytax">
